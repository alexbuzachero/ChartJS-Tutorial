      <p>In this portfolio I will share my studies in Web and App Development, showing the most used technology and some tips that I Have learned on this fantastic journey.</p>

      <h2>React.js</h2>
      <p>My first post will be about React.js, I choose to learn this JavaScript library because I will use this concept to work in my Project 2 at Langara College.</p>
      <p>This tool will provide me the resources enough that I need for data visualization, working as a front-end developer I will be responsible to transform data in a graph.</p>

      <h2>The birth of React</h2>
      <p>Back in 2011, Facebook started to face several issues with code maintenance. Also, because of the Facebook Ads app got an increasing number of several features, was necessary more people to keep it running. Not only this, their app became very hard to handle, as they faced a lot of cascading updates.</p>

      <p>To solve it Jordan Walke built a prototype that made the process more efficient, and this marks the birth of React.js.</p>

      <h2>What is React and how works?</h2>
      <p>It is very simple to understand how efficient is React, React is a declarative and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.</p>
      <p>To simplify how use React in your web page, look the image below:</p>
      <img src="https://coderexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/react-1024x501.png" alt="react webpage">
      <p>In this picture representation each box color represents one React component, and React give you the freedom to work in each component in parallel, and every change that you make inside each component will update the webpage automatically and online.</p>
      <h2>Inside the React component</h2>
      <p>Inside each component, there is a bit of code that represents a piece of the page, and the way that you call each component is very similar the way that we call a function using Javascript.</p>
      <p>The picture below shows a React component example that will return a shop list:</p>
      <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/eqAOXU/component.jpg" alt="react_component2">
      <h2>Prototype Idea</h2>
      <p>In my first prototype, I will use the React to create some simple graph using numbers, this prototype will help me to learn how transform numbers in a graph that will be on an important piece in my final project dashboard.</p>
      <p>Bellow is a simple example of a dashboard that I hope to learn how to build it using React.</p>

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <img src="https://www.scrumakademie.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Story_Writing-300x236.jpg" alt="User Stories" class="imgSmall">
      <p>To have a best understand need to develop this prototype was necessary to create the user stories. Also, <b>what is a user story?</b>? </p>
      <p>A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.</p>
      <h3><u>Prototype User Stories</u></h3>
      <p>As I mentioned before, I want to simulate in my prototype some simple data graph visualizations that can be used by a Landlord / Tenant. Because those situations will be real in my project, and this understanding will be crucial to my project success. </p>
      <p>Follow below my user stories:</p>
      <div class="box">
        <p>As a Landlord, I want to access my dashboard and analyze graphically the tenant list with their risk score.</p>
        <p>As a Landlord, I want to click a button and visualize the number of tenant application monthly.</p>
        <p>As a Tenant, I want to choose a house and analyze the house price history.<p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Progress Report</h2>
        <h3><u>Retrospective</u></h3>
        <p>In the last week, I started my studies in React and research about the best library to create graphs. Also, Graph.js was my choice because this library is very intuitive to use and provide a plenty of different graphs.</p>
        <p>I finished the React crash course and I started the website creation using React components and I built my first graph using Graph.js.</p>
        <h3><u>Kanban Backlog</u></h3>
        <p>To demonstrate my prototype progress I am using the Kanban spreadsheet, through this tool  I can show the items that was accomplished, others itens that I am working and the points to work in the next sprint.</p>
