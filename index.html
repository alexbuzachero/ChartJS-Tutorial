      <h2>React.js</h2>
      <p>My first post will be about React.js, I choose to learn this JavaScript library because I will use this concept to work in my Project 2 at Langara College.</p>
      <p>This tool will provide me the resources enough that I need for data visualization, working as a front-end developer I will be responsible to transform data in a graph.</p>

      <h2>The birth of React</h2>
      <p>Back in 2011, Facebook started to face several issues with code maintenance. Also, because of the Facebook Ads app got an increasing number of several features, was necessary more people to keep it running. Not only this, their app became very hard to handle, as they faced a lot of cascading updates.</p>

      <p>To solve it Jordan Walke built a prototype that made the process more efficient, and this marks the birth of React.js.</p>

      <h2>What is React and how works?</h2>
      <p>It is very simple to understand how efficient is React, React is a declarative and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.</p>
      <p>To simplify how use React in your web page, look the image below:</p>
      <img src="https://coderexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/react-1024x501.png" alt="react webpage">
      <p>In this picture representation each box color represents one React component, and React give you the freedom to work in each component in parallel, and every change that you make inside each component will update the webpage automatically and online.</p>
      <h2>Inside the React component</h2>
      <p>Inside each component, there is a bit of code that represents a piece of the page, and the way that you call each component is very similar the way that we call a function using Javascript.</p>
      <p>The picture below shows a React component example that will return a shop list:</p>
      <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/eqAOXU/component.jpg" alt="react_component2">
      <h2>Prototype Idea</h2>
      <p>In my first prototype, I will use the React to create some simple graph using numbers, this prototype will help me to learn how transform numbers in a graph that will be on an important piece in my final project dashboard.</p>
      <p>Bellow is a simple example of a dashboard that I hope to learn how to build it using React.</p>
      <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/epP6mp/dashboard.jpg" alt="Dashboard">

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <img src="https://www.scrumakademie.de/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Story_Writing-300x236.jpg" alt="User Stories" class="imgSmall">
      <p>To have a best understand need to develop this prototype was necessary to create the user stories. Also, <b>what is a user story?</b>? </p>
      <p>A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.</p>
      <h3><u>Prototype User Stories</u></h3>
      <p>As I mentioned before, I want to simulate in my prototype some simple data graph visualizations that can be used by a Landlord / Tenant. Because those situations will be real in my project, and this understanding will be crucial to my project success. </p>
      <p>Follow below my user stories:</p>
      <div class="box">
        <p>As a Landlord, I want to access my dashboard and analyze graphically the tenant list with their risk score.</p>
        <p>As a Landlord, I want to click a button and visualize the number of tenant application monthly.</p>
        <p>As a Tenant, I want to choose a house and analyze the house price history.<p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <h2>Progress Report</h2>
        <h3><u>Retrospective</u></h3>
        <p>In the last week, I started my studies in React and research about the best library to create graphs. Also, Chart.js was my choice because this library is very intuitive to use and provide a plenty of different graphs.</p>
        <p>I finished the React crash course and I started the website creation using React components and I built my first graph using Chart.js.</p>
        <h3><u>Kanban Backlog</u></h3>
        <p>To demonstrate my prototype progress I am using the Kanban spreadsheet, through this tool  I can show the items that was accomplished, others itens that I am working and the points to work in the next sprint.</p>
        <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/jE6F8e/kanban.jpg" alt="kanban_Backlog">

        <hr>
        <h2>Building the Prototype</h2>
        <p>To create my Prototype was necessary install the chart.js library to create the graph and the React Route to swap the pages.</p>
        <!-- <h3><u>Code to install the Chart.js library </u></h3> -->
        <p><b>Code to install the Chart.js library:  </b>npm install react-chartjs-2 chart.js –save</p>
        <!-- <h3><u>Code to install the React Route</u></h3> -->
        <p><b>Code to install the React Route:  </b>npm i --dev---save react-router-dom</p>

        <h2>Creating the Graph</h2>
        <p>To create the graph is necessary import the chart.js in the page, using the import command as the picture below.</p>
        <img src="https://image.ibb.co/c8yCop/01.jpg" alt="Import Chart">

        <p>The graph data was extracted from a JSON file, the first step I imported the JSON file and then I used a for loop to populate the label and data array with those data, bellow you can see importing and extracting the data in my code.</p>
        <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/bQ9Gg9/02.jpg" alt="Extract Data">

        <p>I used those variables (labels and data2) to call the extract function and to insert the data in the graph, and I create one variable called “dataGraph” with all the information that the chart.js needs to render the graph, and I used this variable (dataGraph) inside the chart data.</p>
        <img src="https://image.ibb.co/cWzGg9/chartdata.jpg" alt="Chart Data">

        <h2>Using React Router</h2>
        <p>The Route is essential in React, because React is a single-page application and the way to swap between pages is using the Route command.</p>
        <p>First, you need to import the BrowserRouter and encapsulate the page div area that will be Router with the  Router property. After that, only use Route in the pages component that you want to swap in the page, as the screenshot below:</p>

        <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/c1xPZU/03.jpg" alt="React Router">

        <h3><u>Calling the page router using React Link</u></h3>
        <p>After you create the Router as the previews example you need to create the links to call the page component, to do it the first thing is importing the router link and after create the Link passing the path inside as an argument. The best way to understand is observing the picture below:</p>
        <img src="https://image.ibb.co/n8aYTp/04.jpg" alt="React Link">

        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <p>The previews explanation was overall about the techniques that I used to create my Prototype and if you want to see my prototype in action, click on the link below:</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <p>During the prototype development, I could put in practice all the knowledge that I acquired studying React.js, through this journey I could have a better understanding about how the React components works and the importance to use props to exchange values between different components.</p>
        <p>Another two important points that I learned was the Router functionality that allow us to swap pages inside React, and how to use Chart.js to extract JSON file data and render that information inside the Graph.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Project Plan</h2>
        <p>After all the knowledge acquired working with React.js and Chart, as a front-end developer role I will be in charge to create the Landlord Dashboard, where I will use data sent by the back-end team and render those data as a graph.</p>
        <p>This new challenge will provide me a new opportunity to improve my React skills, since not only Graph will be rendered in our Dashboard, but also all the tenant profile information that was represented in our first version wireframe, created by our designer Felipe Almeida.</p>
        <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/jbBJuU/05.jpg" alt="First Dashboard">

        <h2>Langara Term 3 - Project 2</h2>

        <p>After working hard in my prototype, now I am already to apply my knowledge acquired developing that prototype and work in our real project. I will use React.js and Graph.js to build all the landlord dashboard.</p>
        <p>Before I share my Project User stories I want to do a little introduction about our Project Idea.</p>
        <h3><b>Rental Moose</b></h3>
        <p>Rental Moose is a Website that provides an opportunity to Landlord offer house to rent, and on the other side, the future tenant can access our website to consult a plenty of houses available to rent. However, the main focus in our Term 3 project is Data Visualization, because of that the tenant need to fill a form and through this data, we will create the tenant score. Also, that information will be essential to create the dashboard that the Landlord can analyze the score of each possible tenant. In this case, our data visualization will be detailing about different criteria that were used to reach that Tenant score and representing in graph format.</p>

        <h2>Project User Stories</h2>

        <div class="box">
          <p>As a New user, I want to Register a new account and I can use the services for either finds a place to rent or rent out my existing place.</p>
          <p>As a Landlord, I want to see who is interesting to rent my place and I can check the tenant Risk score and using that decide who has the best tenant profile.</p>
          <p>As a Tenant, I want to see a list of properties that are available for rent and I can apply to rent the place that I want. <p>
          </div>

       <h2>Progress Report (20%)</h2>
       <p>This new report is about my Langara Project 2, in the group chores division I and Felipe Almeida are responsible by the Front-end and Project Designer. In our team, Felipe main focus will be on Designer and my focus will be on reproducing his Mockups in React website and creating the Dashboard Charts.</p>
       <p>In our first division, my initial response in our group are listed below in a Kanban Backlog, and what I finished until this point are checked in the Done column.</p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/m4e6bV/kanban25.jpg" alt="Kanban25">

       <hr>
       <h2>Progress Report (40%) </h2>

       <p>In This second report, the main feature that I had finished was the project Dashboard, I created this dashboard following our Wireframe layout, and in the future task, I will structure this Dashboard using sass according to our Mockup that was developed by our Designer team member.</p>
       <p>The image below is the Dashboard that I created in our project, this is the version before apply the Mockup design structure.</p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/nqdGcf/Dashboard.jpg" alt="DashboardProject">
       <br>
       <p>My current project progress is listed in the Kanban Backlog bellow, that was included more 4 tasks, those tasks are to create the mobile dashboard and rental page layout and formatting them according to their mockup.</p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/g7e6cf/kanban26.jpg" alt="Kanban26">

       <hr>
       <h2>Progress Report (60%) </h2>

       <p>In my third Report, I finished with success the dashboard giving a better interface following our Design Mockup, as can you see below this is our new dashboard after formatting using sass.</p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/nhuayV/Dashboard-OK.jpg" alt="Dashboard-OK">
<br><br>
       <p>To navigate between tenant, I created two buttons that will call a function that will increment/decrement the array index and then will change the dashboard with the current tenant that belongs that index position using React props. Both functions are demonstrated below.</p>
       <img src="https://image.ibb.co/fphOkA/function-Next.jpg" alt="function-Next">
       <br><br>
       <p>I finished the components to create the Landlord rental page, this page will show the Tenant list. Also, when select one tenant the user will be redirect to the dashboard for the correspondent tenant. This page was created but for the next sprint, I will work to router the tenant name component with his correspondent dashboard page and formatting following the mockup.</p>
       <p>This is the current Landlord rental page without the mockup formatting.</p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/eXykyV/Rental-Page-Landlord.jpg" alt="Rental-Page-Landlord">
       <br><br>
       <p>Bellow is representing my current Kanban Backlog, and for the next sprint I will route the tenant list with the dashboard, and create a function to change automatically the tenant risk score background accordingly with their risk.</p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/dukhdV/kanban27.jpg" alt="kanban27">

       <h2>Progress Report (80%)</h2>
       <p>In this sprint, I finished the tenant react link to pass the ID to the dashboard page and to open the correspondent dashboard tenant, and the another finished task was to change automatically the score background color accordingly with their score.</p>
       <h3><b>Linking tenant with the dashboard</b></h3>
       <p>To link the tenant with the dashboard was necessary to use react router link, and inside the link properties I passed the Dashboard path and the tenant ID using "state" as can be identified in the picture below:</p>
       <img src="https://image.ibb.co/eyUGPf/tenant-Link.jpg" alt="tenant-Link" class="center" style="width: 450px;"><br>
       <h3><b>Changing tenant background score color</b></h3>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/jeVyLL/score.jpg" alt="score" class="center" style="width: 700px;"><br>
       <p>To change the background score color I used a class variable "scoreClasses" to the score div area.</p>
       <img src="https://image.ibb.co/k1kvH0/divScore.jpg" alt="divScore" class="center" style="width: 350px;"><br>
       <p>After that, I create a function that depends with the tenant score the function will concat the respectivly class int the "scoreClasses" variable, this function is demonstrated in the picture below:</p>
       <img src="https://image.ibb.co/fUJt4f/score-Variable.jpg" alt="score-Variable" class="center" style="width: 350px;"><br>
       <p>The CSS with the respective color is demonstrated in the picture below:</p>
       <img src="https://image.ibb.co/dEQHVL/score-Variable-CSS.jpg" alt="score-Variable-CSS" class="center" style="width: 350px;"><br>
       <p>Bellow is representing my current Kanban Backlog with those modifications, and for the next sprint I will work to design the interface following the rental page mockup, and configure the rental page to mobile size. </p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/cvFHVL/kanban28.jpg" alt="kanban28">

       <h2>Progress Report (90%)</h2>
       <p>In the last sprint, I finished the tenant react link to pass the ID to the dashboard page and open the correspondent dashboard tenant, and to change automatically the score background color accordingly with their score.</p>
       <p>In this sprint, I concluded the Landlord Rental Page layout following the Mockup created by our designer (picture below), and I started the code to restructure the Dashboard layout to the mobile size. </p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/nasqFV/rentalpage-mockup.jpg" alt="rentalpage-mockup"><br><br>
       <p>I didn`t have time to conclude the Dashboard in mobile size because of a lake of time since we had a plenty of assignments and a midterm that consumed my time.</p>
       <p>The positive point in this sprint was that I could improve my sass knowledge exchanging ideas with our designer member to reproduce the Landlord Rental Page. On the other hand, I didn`t have time enough to focus 100% on our project, because of that the dashboard mobile size that supposes to finish this sprint will be concluded in the next sprint.</p>
       <p>For the next sprint, I will finish the Dashboard mobile size layout and I will work in the Landlord Rent Page mobile size structure too, as the Kanban Backlog below shows.</p>
       <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/htJK9q/kanban29.jpg" alt="kanban29">

       <h2>Progress Report (95%)</h2>
       <p>In the last sprint, I finished the Landlord Rental Page layout following the Mockup created by our designer, and I started the code to restructure the Dashboard layout to the mobile size. </p>
       <p>In this sprint, I finished the last two tasks that I had to conclude this project, that was to configure the mobile layout size to Landlord Rental Page and the Dashboard.</p>
       <p>First, I finished the Dashboard mobile layout that I had started in the last sprint, to position the React components differently in both sizes (Mobile and Desktop size) I used display grid. I`m showing in the picture below an example how I used display grid in the Dashboard to change the layout in both sizes:</p>
       <img src="https://i.ibb.co/NYK777G/Dashboard-Layout.jpg" alt="Dashboard-Layout" >
       <br><br>
       <p>In the pictures below you can see the Landlord Rental Page and the Dashboard in desktop and Mobile size:</p>
       <h3>Landlord Page (Desktop Size)</h3>
       <img src="https://i.ibb.co/hDZrsdL/LAndlord-Destop.jpg" alt="LAndlord-Destop" >
       <h3>Landlord Page (Mobile Size)</h3>
       <img src="https://i.ibb.co/1ZmL9yW/LAndlord-Mobile.jpg" alt="LAndlord-Mobile" class="mobile">
       <h3>Dashboard (Desktop Size)</h3>

       <h3>Dashboard (Mobile Size)</h3>
       <img src="https://i.ibb.co/sRPR71m/Dashboard-Mobile.jpg" alt="Dashboard-Mobile" class="mobile">
       <p>The positive point about this sprint was that I could conclude both layouts following the Designer wireframe with 100% of accuracy, was not an easy job but the result worth all the effort. In addition, I didn`t have any negative point to mention about this sprint.</p>
       <p>I`m so proud to share my Kanban Backlog in this report (picture below), because I could conclude all the tasks that I was responsible to finish this project. Also, for the next report, I will talk about my project retrospective and the Lessons Learned in this project.</p>

       <h2>Final Check-in</h2>
       <p>After a long-term working in this project, we concluded it. Also, this is only the end of this project but a start of a new window of opportunities that this project offered me because learning React change my mind how you can work in the front-end development using a simple page concept. Not only that, working with Chart.js showed me how powerful this library can be in transform data in visual information, including colors and animations.</p>
       <p>All the front-end of our website was developed by me and Felipe Almeida, he was responsible to work with the website designer, and he built the landing pages, house cards components, header and nav structure, his work you can check clicking in this <a href="https://fepirata.github.io/felipealmeida/"  target="_blank">link.</a></p>
       <p>On the other hand, I was responsible to work with the data visualization part, I built the Landlord Dashboard, Landlord Rental page with the tenant waitlist, the property detail page, and I connected all house cards with his respective property page, and each tenant with his respective dashboard.</p>
       <p>Finally, to check over our final webpage you can click in the Rental Mouse logo below:</p>

       <br><br>
      <h2>Retrospective</h2>
      <h3>What went well</h3>
      <p>For sure the way that Chart.js worked with React was essential to the success of our project since the main focus of this project was data visualization.</p>
      <p>Another important point was the good experience of exchanging Ideas and chores with Felipe in the front-end, we could balance the front-end work and was very positive our final result working together.</p>
      <h3>What did not go well</h3>
      <p>Because of the lack of time, we didn`t have time to make all react components in a smart way, some components we created inside the webpage as a normal HTML, only the main components as cards, header, nav, and chart, for example, we created as a separate component calling them and passing information using props.</p>
      <h3>What was interesting </h3>
      <p>Actually, there is no specific interesting point because the whole learning process was interesting for me. Also, I can mention that the single page concept that React works is amazing and opened to me a new view about front-end development.</p>
      <h3>What would be done differently next time</h3>
      <p>I used the Ajax methodology to fetch the dashboard data with our API. However, in the next opportunity, I should spend more time to learn new ways to fetch data using React because there is another simple way to fetching data using React, but I didn`t have time to research a different way because of the lack of time to conclude the project.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>This project was a challenge for all of us, where we faced some college problems and necessity to learn new technologies to apply in this project. However, the Rental Mouse team was amazing and because of the team synergy we could overcome all these obstacles and finalize with a successful project.</p>
